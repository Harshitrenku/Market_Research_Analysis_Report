# Market Research Analysis Report | Power BI Dashboard


## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard was developed as part of a market research initiative by **MarketMindz**, a market intelligence firm collaborating with a small but growing **food & beverage retail vendor**. The primary objective is to help the client better understand their **marketing campaign performance**, **product trends**, and **customer behavior**, ultimately guiding data-driven business decisions.

## 🧠 Business Scenario

The retail client is in the early stages of market expansion and seeks clarity on:

1. **How are our 6 recent marketing campaigns performing?**
2. **How are our product categories selling?**
3. **Who are our customers demographically and behaviorally?**
4. **What factors influence campaign acceptance and purchase behavior?**
